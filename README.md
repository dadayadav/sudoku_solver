# Sudoku Solver

A Simple in-terminal application to solve Sudoku puzzle. It can solve majority of Sudoku puzzles but skips the ones which are too tough. This is one of my first projects.

## Getting Started
To compile:
1: Open Terminal and go to the project directory.
2: Type 'make' to compile the project
```
make
```
3: The compiled file can be found in build/apps
4: To run the file, go to build/apps/ and open terminal and type ./sudoku_solver
```
./sudoku_solver
```
5: Enter the puzzle in the form:
```
025003070
700625004
000009005
839000040
010040030
070000928
900300000
100592003
050700690
```
